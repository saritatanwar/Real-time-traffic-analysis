# US Accidents Dataset Analysis

## Overview
- **Source**: Kaggle ([US Accident Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents/data))
- **Description**: This dataset includes 7.7 million records of traffic accidents in the US from 2016 to 2021.
- **Data Points**: Time, location (latitude/longitude), weather, severity, etc.

## Real-Time Data Capture Mechanisms

The US Accident dataset from Kaggle is classified as a "live" dataset, with metadata fields that ensure its real-time relevance. Key metadata fields supporting this are:

- **Timestamps**: Each entry includes a timestamp showing the date and time of the accident, regularly updated to reflect recent incidents.
- **Location Data**: The latitude and longitude coordinates allow for precise location tracking of each accident, useful for mapping current traffic issues.
- **Weather and Road Conditions**: Metadata fields such as weather status and road conditions at the accident time suggest live or recently captured environmental factors.
- **Data Feed Status**: An indicator of the data feed status shows whether the connection is active, ensuring the dataset receives ongoing updates.
- **Update Frequency**: The datasetâ€™s metadata suggests updates every [specify frequency if known], ensuring data remains live and current for real-time analysis.

This metadata framework ensures that the dataset remains relevant for live analysis, capturing traffic accidents as they occur with real-time environmental details.


## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Manipulation**: Python, Pandas, NumPy.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Chart.js.
- **Version Control**: GitHub for managing project updates.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Data Volume**: Use PySpark for scalable data processing.
- **Metadata Consistency**: Implement validation scripts for timestamps, locations.
- **Real-Time Integration**: Queue and format data from APIs for consistency.

## Conclusion
This project explores historical accident data to inform real-time traffic analysis tools, addressing challenges of data volume, consistency, and real-time integration.
